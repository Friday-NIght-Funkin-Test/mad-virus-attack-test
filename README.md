It's 8-Bit from Brawl Stars and Friday Night Funkin' Mad Virus Attack! Go crazy with 8-Bit's beeps and bops! Play as 8 Bit and Bf! Play on the web here on a PC/Mobile devices! If you want, you can download it with the download button below for Windows, Mac, and Linux systems!

Controls: 

When you load up the game, if you want touch control, press the toggle in the corner for the virtual controls button. I also recommend playing this on Google Chrome on mobile.  

Arrow keys to play the sounds (For mobile press D-pad button)

Hold Space and any other arrow for secondary soundboard



Click on the Character icon on the corner to switch between 8-Bit and Bf   

Secret key = ??? ;)
